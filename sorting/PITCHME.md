**Sorting**

**Follows Weiss Chapter 7**

We are probably all familiar with sorting - ordering elements from smallest to largest (or largest to smallest).

While it is very easy for humans to sort things, it can be tricky to teach a computer to do so efficiently.
---
We are going to talk about several sorting algorithms in these sections, each of them will have a signature similar to the following:

```
void sortingMethod( vector<Comparable> & a);
```

Where ```a``` is an array (here a vector) that we want sorted in memory.
---
Be aware that the C++ STL (and most languages) provide optimized sorting implementations; in general you should be using those in your programming and not trying to roll your own or use the ones here (these are correct but not necessarily optimal).
---
Since C++ wishes to be able to use the same sorting methods for a variety of collections, the C++ function signatures will all take iterators, i.e.:

```C++
void sort(Iterator begin, Iterator end);
void sort(Iterator begin, Iterator end, Comparator cmp);
...
etc.
```

I believe that it is easier to learn when we are exposed to a topic in a variety of different ways.  To that end, we will be learning sorting through

- examining the algorithms
- manipulating physical and virtual objects
- listening to auditory implementations of how the algorithms work
- dance

Seriously, yes dance.  You're going to love it.
